       "\n",
       "*   `yield from`: This keyword is used to delegate the execution to another iterator. The \"from\" keyword indicates that we're yielding values from another source.\n",

       "\n",
       "    -   **`for book in books`**: This part of the expression iterates over an iterable sequence of books (e.g., a list or dictionary).\n",
       "    -   `if book.get(\"author\")`: The `get()` method returns a value (`None` by default) for the key `\"author\"` if it exists in the book. If not, it is skipped.\n",
       "    -   `{book.get(\"author\")}`: For each book that passes the condition, this expression retrieves and yields the author's name from the dictionary.\n",

       "**Why is it used?**\n",
       "--------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "This line of code is often used in scenarios where you want to filter or transform data based on certain conditions. In this case, it's filtering out books without authors before yielding their authors.\n",
